# Grep Implementation

This project implements a simplified version of the `grep` command using regular expressions. It includes functionality for pattern matching, supporting features like character matching, quantifiers, group capturing, references, and backreferences. The project also covers various regex components such as character classes, anchors, and alternation.

## Topics Covered

1. **Introduction**
   - Overview of the project and its purpose.
   
2. **Repository Setup**
   - Instructions for setting up the repository and required dependencies.

3. **Match a Literal Character**
   - Implemented basic character matching functionality to match literal characters in input strings.

4. **Match Digits**
   - Implemented the ability to match digits using the `\d` pattern.

5. **Match Alphanumeric Characters**
   - Support for matching alphanumeric characters using the `\w` pattern.

6. **Positive Character Groups**
   - Matching specific character sets using character classes.

7. **Negative Character Groups**
   - Implemented negative character classes to match characters not in the set.

8. **Combining Character Classes**
   - Combined multiple character classes to match more complex patterns.

9. **Start of String Anchor (`^`)**
   - Implemented functionality to match the start of a string using the `^` anchor.

10. **End of String Anchor (`$`)**
    - Implemented functionality to match the end of a string using the `$` anchor.

11. **Match One or More Times**
    - Implemented the `+` quantifier to match one or more occurrences of a pattern.

12. **Match Zero or One Time**
    - Implemented the `?` quantifier to match zero or one occurrence of a pattern.

13. **Wildcard (`.`)**
    - Implemented the wildcard character `.` to match any character.

14. **Alternation (`|`)**
    - Support for alternation to match either one pattern or another.

15. **Backreferences**
    - Implemented support for backreferences to refer to previously captured groups.

16. **Single Backreference**
    - Implemented functionality for single backreferences using the `\1` syntax.

17. **Multiple Backreferences**
    - Support for multiple backreferences using the `\1`, `\2`, etc., syntax.

18. **Nested Backreferences**
    - Implemented support for nested backreferences, allowing more complex patterns.

## Features

- **Matcher Classes**: Various matcher classes for different regex components like `CharMatcher`, `ListMatcher`, `StartMatcher`, `EndMatcher`, and `GroupMatcher`.
- **Quantifiers**: Support for quantifiers like `+` and `?` to match one or more times or zero or one time, respectively.
- **Backreferences**: Implemented both single and multiple backreferences with support for nested backreferences.
- **Pattern Parsing**: The engine parses regex patterns and applies them to input text using recursive parsing.

## Usage

To use the grep implementation, run the following command:

```bash
python grep.py -E <pattern> < input_file
```

Where:
- `-E` specifies to use extended regex patterns.
- `<pattern>` is the regex pattern you want to match.
- `<input_file>` is the input file containing the text you want to search.

## Example

For example, to search for a pattern that matches one or more digits:

```bash
python grep.py -E '\d+' < input.txt
```

This will search for one or more digits in the `input.txt` file.
